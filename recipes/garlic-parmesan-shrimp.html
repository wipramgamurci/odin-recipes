		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Delicious crispy shrimp coated in a bread crumb-Parmesan mixture. My family can't get enough of it! I would suggest doubling the recipe if you have very large eaters because this is addictive! Serve with pasta and salad.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>non-stick cooking spray</li>
			<li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
			<li>1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
			<li>2 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
			<li>1&#189; teaspoons garlic powder</li>
			<li>1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
			<li>2 tablespoon butter, melted, or more to taste</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch glass casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
			<li>Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, and garlic powder in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal and shake to mix ingredients together. Add shrimp and shake to coat.</li>
			<li>Lay shrimp flat in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with any bread crumb mixture remaining in the bag. Drizzle melted butter over the top.</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven until starting to crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Switch to broil setting until topping is light brown, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
		</ol>
